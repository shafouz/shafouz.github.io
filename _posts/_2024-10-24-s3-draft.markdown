It all started with this one ctf challenge.
There was a bucket with the `ListObjectVersions` permission on.
And you found the flag by looking through the old versions of the files. 
That gave me inspiration to try this out in a bug bounty program that i used to hack on.

At first i ran a custom python script to check for misconfigurations but nothing caught my attention.
Then i realized that the `ListObjects` permission was set.
After listing and filtering every file available there were a lot of .nupkg files.

.nupkg is just a .zip file that NuGet (.Net package manager) uses to transfer packages.

The interesting part was that these packages were from the company. Like `<company>.store.web.nupkg`.
So potential actual source code? When looking inside that proved to be correct.
